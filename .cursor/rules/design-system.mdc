# Braun-Inspired Design System

This project follows design principles inspired by Dieter Rams' work at Braun:

## Core Principles
- "Less, but better"
- Focus on functionality and clarity
- Eliminate unnecessary elements
- Use consistent patterns and components

## Design Reference
Refer to our comprehensive design document for detailed specifications:

@design.md

## Typography
- Use JetBrains Mono as the primary font
- Follow the mathematical type scale (1.2 ratio)
- Maintain proper hierarchy through weight not size
- Line heights: 1.5 for body, 1.2 for headings

## Spacing
- Base unit: 8px
- All spacing should be multiples of the base unit
- Maintain consistent vertical rhythm
- Use the 12-column grid system with 24px gutters

## Colors
- Primary: Off-white (#f6f6f6), Charcoal black (#1a1a1a), Accent pink (#FF187C)
- Secondary: Light gray (#e0e0e0), Mid gray (#888888), Dark gray (#333333)
- Use colors purposefully and minimally

## UI Components
Always use the shadcn/ui component library and follow these guidelines:
- Buttons should be simple rectangles with clear purpose
- Cards should have clean backgrounds with minimal decoration
- Navigation should be unobtrusive yet accessible
- Controls should be minimal with high contrast
