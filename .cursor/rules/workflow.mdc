# Development Workflow

Follow these practices for efficient and consistent development:

## Package Management
- Always use **pnpm** instead of npm or yarn
- Add new dependencies with `pnpm add [package]`
- Add dev dependencies with `pnpm add -D [package]`
- Use `pnpm run dev` to start the development server

## Next.js App Router
- Place page components in the `src/app` directory
- Create new routes by adding directories within `app`
- Use layout components for shared UI
- Leverage React Server Components where possible

## Testing
- Write tests for all components and utilities
- Use Vitest for running tests
- Use React Testing Library for component testing
- Follow a behavior-driven testing approach

## Code Quality
- Run `pnpm lint` to check for linting errors
- Run `pnpm format` to format code with Prettier
- Commit changes with descriptive commit messages
- Review code before submitting PRs
