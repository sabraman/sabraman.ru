# Design System: SABRAMAN / КАРТОН

This document outlines the design principles for sabraman.ru - Danya Yudin's personal brand website, inspired by Braun design.

## Conceptual Foundation

The design follows Dieter Rams' "Less, but better" philosophy with inspiration from:

- Functional Minimalism: Clean interfaces with purpose-driven elements
- Industrial Precision: Geometric forms and precise measurements
- Honest Materials: Authentic textures and natural color palette
- Timeless Utility: Functionality that doesn't expire with trends

## Identity Structure

- Danya Yudin: Professional identity (developer/designer)
- SABRAMAN: Primary online identity used across platforms
- КАРТОН (KARTON): Secondary nickname meaning "cardboard" in Russian

## Visual Language

### Typography

- Font Family: Monospace exclusively (JetBrains Mono)
- Hierarchy: Minimal variation, focusing on spacing and weight
- Text Treatment: Clean, balanced, with sufficient negative space
- Spacing: Precise grid-based alignment

### Color Palette

- Primary Colors:

  - Off-white (#f6f6f6)
  - Charcoal black (#1a1a1a)
  - Accent pink (#FF187C)

- Secondary Colors:
  - Light gray (#e0e0e0)
  - Mid gray (#888888)
  - Dark gray (#333333)

### Layout System

- Grid-Based: Modular grid with mathematical proportions
- White Space: Generous negative space to highlight content
- Proportions: Elements sized according to golden ratio (1:1.618)
- Alignment: Precise horizontal and vertical alignment

### UI Elements

- Toggle Switches: Minimal, high-contrast controls
- Buttons: Simple rectangular forms with clear purpose
- Navigation: Unobtrusive yet accessible
- Cards: Clean content containers with clear hierarchy
- Icons: Simple, geometric, and functional

## Design Principles

1. Useful: Every element serves a clear purpose
2. Understandable: Intuitive interfaces requiring minimal explanation
3. Unobtrusive: Design that supports content without overshadowing it
4. Honest: Visual elements that represent their function truthfully
5. Long-lasting: Avoiding trendy elements that quickly become dated
6. Thorough: Attention to detail down to the pixel level
7. Environmentally Friendly: Digital efficiency and sustainable approach
8. As Little Design as Possible: Focus on the essential, remove the unnecessary

## Interactive Elements

- Precise Transitions: Subtle, purposeful animations
- Clear States: Obvious active/hover/disabled states
- Feedback: Minimal but clear user feedback
- Focus Indicators: Accessible but unobtrusive focus states

## Implementation Guidelines

### Typography Standards

- Font: JetBrains Mono
- Scale: Based on mathematical progression (1.2 ratio)
- Weights: Regular (400) for body, Medium (500) for subheadings, Bold (700) for headings
- Line Height: 1.5 for body text, 1.2 for headings

### Spacing System

- Base Unit: 8px
- Padding: Multiples of the base unit (8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, etc.)
- Margins: Consistent application of spacing scale
- Layout Grid: 12-column system with 24px gutters

### Component Design

- Controls: Minimal with high affordance
- Containers: Clean rectangles with subtle borders or shadows
- Cards: White backgrounds with minimal decoration
- Navigation: Clear hierarchy with minimal visual noise

### Responsive Strategy

- Mobile-First: Design begins with smallest screens
- Breakpoints: 480px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px
- Adaptability: Components retain their essential character across screen sizes
